        <h2 class="sub-heading text-center">So you decided to play Magic: The Gathering?</h2>

        <p>You've joined a community worldwide of enthusiatic players, collecters and content creators enjoying this
          strategic
          and fun TCG. Let's first learn some of the history of this storied card game.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">What is Magic: The Gathering?</h3>
        <p>Magic: The Gathering (often abbreveated to MTG) is a trading card game - also known as a collectible card
          game -
          originally created by designer Richard Garfield and released by Wizards of the Coast in 1993. Widely
          considered
          the
          first trading card game, the game typically sees two players compete to defeat their opponent first by
          spending
          mana
          to play creatures, spells and other items and abilities.</p>

        <p>Players can customise their deck before each battle, choosing cards from their library and - depending on the
          format -
          the current legal pool of sets and expansions. More than 20,000 different cards have been released for Magic:
          The
          Gathering since it first released more than 25 years ago, with over 20 billion cards printed between 2008 and
          2016
          alone.</p>

        <p>Some of MTG's most popular cards often see reprints in new sets, while other cards considered too powerful
          can
          be
          banned or restricted in certain formats to keep the game's competitive scene fair. The sets permitted for
          tournament
          play in the Standard format periodically change to include only the four most recent sets released for the
          game,
          an
          action known as rotation. The sets allowed in other formats depend on the format itself. Of course, some of
          them
          aren't in games because they're prohibitively, ridiculously expensive.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Is Magic: The Gathering easy to learn?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely, anyone can get to grips with the basic rules after a few matches - not just strategy gamers! MTG
          has
          a
          range of starter sets both online and off that guide you through the game - starting with simple creatures and
          spells,
          before moving onto planeswalkers and more complex cards. It's very easy to learn how to play Magic:The
          Gathering, as
          you can start with simple pre-made card sets before advancing onto making your own deck.

          In addition, you can find places to play Magic: The Gathering via the official <a
            href="https://locator.wizards.com" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast locator</a>,
          which
          tells you what shops are running events. Every week, Friday Night Magic is run in stores and other locations
          across
          the world.

          These social events are a great way to enjoy the game socially, and also eke out the rules with more
          experienced
          players. Staff at the locations are often happy to help you out, perhaps even playing a few hands with you to
          get you
          orientated.</p>
