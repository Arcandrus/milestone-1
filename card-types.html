      <h2 class="sub-heading text-center">Card types explained</h2>
      <p class="text-center">There are many different card types in Magic: the Gathering which represent how you draw
        power as a mage as well
        as the spells you can cast.</p>
      <p class="text-center">Let's look over the most common ones below.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <div class="row col-12">
          <h3 class="sub-heading text-center">Lands</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="align-middle col-12 col-md-4">
            <img src="assets/images/land.png" alt="A basic Island land from Magic: the Gathering">
          </div>
          <div class="card-body col-12 col-md-8">
            <p class="card-text">Lands are the most common and basic type of card you are likely to come across. Lands
              represent
              locations under the player's control, most of which have mana abilities. Because mana is needed
              to use almost any card or ability, most decks need a high number of mana-producing lands
              (typically between 33-50% of the total deck) to function effectively. Taking mana from the lands
              represents the strands of magic and the most commonly printed Magic cards are the five basic
              lands, one for each color, each of which intrinsically produces one mana of a specific color.

      <div class="card">
        <div class="row col-12">
          <h3 class="sub-heading text-center">Creatures</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="align-middle col-12 col-md-4">
            <img src="assets/images/creature.jpg" alt="A Grizzly Bear from Magic: the Gathering">
          </div>
          <div class="card-body col-12 col-md-8">
            <p>Creatures are summoned under the control of the casting player during a main phase and for the
              first turn, they has what is commonly called "summoning sickness" until the beginning of its
              controller's next turn. A creature with summoning sickness cannot attack or use an activated
              ability with the tap or untap symbol in its cost, but it can block or use any other abilities it
              has.
              <br>
              On the bottom-right corner of each creature card is that creature's power and toughness,
              respectively. The power is the amount of damage a creature deals to an opponent or other
              creatures in combat, and the toughness is the amount of damage a creature can survive. A
              creature with damage equal to or greater than its toughness has "lethal damage," and is
              destroyed. Similarly, a creature whose toughness is reduced to zero or less will go to its
              owner's graveyard. Any damage a creature takes will accumulate until the end of the turn when
              all damage is removed from all creatures.

            <p class="card-text">Sorceries are never put onto battlefield; instead, they take effect when their mana
              cost is paid
              and the spell resolves. Sorceries share the timing restrictions as all permanent spell types,
              that is, only be during the player's main phase, and only when nothing else is on the stack.
              <br>
              Sorceries are often one shot abilities that can either help you or hurt your opponents efforts to
              gain advantage. Once they are used, they are put into the graveyard

              played at almost any time during the game, including during other player's turns and while another spell
              or ability is waiting to resolve.
              <br>
              Instants, like Sorceries, are often one shot abilities that can either help you or hurt your opponents
              efforts to gain advantage. Once they are used, they are put into the graveyard.

              remaining in play indefinitely.
              <br>
              Most enchantments have continuous effects or triggered abilities, but some have abilities that can be
              activated by their controllers. Occasionally, some creatures or other cards can also have the sub-type
              enchantment, which means they are effected by cards that effect both.

              as many other cards can also be a Magic “artifact” such as creatures or even lands. As with the
              enchantment example, this means they can be effected by cards that effect both.

          <div class="card-body col-12 col-md-8">
            <p class="card-text">Like the player, a planeswalker card represents a powerful being that can move from
              plane to plane.
              <br>
              Planeswalkers have an intrinsic ability to enter the battlefield with a set number of loyalty counters,
              printed in the lower right of the card. A planeswalker can be attacked, like a player, or be damaged by an
              opponent's spell or ability. Any damage dealt to planeswalkers removes that many loyalty counters and a
              planeswalker with no loyalty counters is put into the graveyard.
              <br>
              Planeswalkers typically have three abilities: one ability that adds loyalty counters as a cost for a small
              benefit, one that removes a small number of counters as a cost for a larger effect, and one that removes a
              large number of loyalty counters for a big effect. The last effect is commonly referred to as the
              planeswalker's "ultimate" ability and usually leaves the opponent in a devastated state. The starting
              loyalty of a planeswalker is commonly significantly lower than the cost of its ultimate and a player has
              to build up the loyalty to access it.
